# alpacka

Wrappers for package managers

# What is it?

The `alpacka` scripts are wrappers around popular package management commands (e.g. `apt`, `yum`, `tazpkg`) allowing you to issue similar commands on any supported system.

It installs to `/usr/local/bin` as the `paf` command (historical naming reasons lost...) and you just about reliably use it in the exact same way on anny of Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS and SliTaz

## Why?

Because I am too lazy to remember which command has what option names; and in some cases to get over some limitations of the package manager itself.
