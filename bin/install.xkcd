$(basename $0) - A modified version of the xkcd Universal Installer

	Do not use in production

Tries a plethora of installers to get the package you want.

	Inspired by http://xkcd.com/1654/

	Do not use in production

If run without root proileges, this scirpt will try to use pip in user mode, then try to download a git version locally.

If you run it with root permissions, OS package managers will be attempted, then secondary package managers like pip, brew, etc, then a local build will be attempted.

	Do not run in production

The logs are kept in ~/logs

	Do not u...
	... you're a responsible person I hope.
